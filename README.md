# NLP Application for Visually Impaired

The main aim of our application is to help partially and fully visually impaired individuals with simple tasks that, for them, might be difficult to implement. The options provided are reading a document, recitation of its summary, keeping and maintaining notes, and sending as well as receiving emails.
